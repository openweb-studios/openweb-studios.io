Repository for OpenWeb itself

1) OpenWeb Studios is not a company or, an organization operating in an official capacity in any way and, 
   is in no way for hire. We are an extension of a German Search Solutions organization called ESEMOS GmbH
   (www.esemos.de).

2) OpenWeb - The meaning, the signifigance. It has relevance and purpose although more and more, less so. 
    Why less so? The Web won the war. However, when the name Open-Web was originally popular and prominent, circa 2008 - 2012, this victory wasnt a certainty. SilverLight, Flash, and JavaFX -- All the major players in the industry had web front-end solutions that were not inherently open, where the standards (or elements, as is better for our purposes) were inherantly open. 
    
    These stnadards delivered through the W3C - (https://www.w3.org/), and the frameworks built upon them, were inherently open, and could be referred to collectively as The Open Web. But, why call these elements rather then Standards -- Because, they, each individual standard or, TC, becomes, as it is released and adopted, part of a greater API, essentially, the foundation, at minimum, for a set of APIs implemented by Browser
    Vendors but, more likely, incorporated into existing frameworks and, sometimes, givine inspiration to new
    frameworks, which then again get incorporated (sometimes into other existing frameworks).
